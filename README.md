# LUOS
Lewis University OS - A Simple Kernel

This project is being built following a tutorial that can be found: https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial

This tutorial is being used to build and understand how to load code from a sector of disk using BIOS, printing text using BIOS and
eventually booting into 32 bit mode. This README will be updated as code is added.
